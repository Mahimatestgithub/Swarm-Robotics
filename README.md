# Swarm-Robotics
Swarm robotics is like a team of robots working together . They can do amazing things, like finding objects or exploring unknown areas. They don't need someone to tell them what to do because they follow simple rules and talk to each other to figure out the best way to get the job done. It's kind of like teamwork in nature
